# **App Name**: Rolebase

## Core Features:

- Authentication: Require users to log in before accessing any part of the application.
- Role Management: Implement role-based access control to determine which functionalities are available to each user.  Roles will be managed in a Firebase database.
- App Shell: Create a responsive app shell with a top navigation bar (profile and logout icons) and a right-side mobile-first menu for navigation.
- Content Display: Display lists of data from Firebase collections in the main content area.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: rgb(2,72,143) for headers and main interactive elements.
- Secondary color: rgb(102,182,22) for accents and highlights.
- Neutral background (e.g., light gray or off-white) for content focus.
- Clean and readable sans-serif font for content and UI elements.
- Mobile-first responsive design for seamless adaptation to different screen sizes.
- Use simple, outlined icons for profile, logout, and menu items.
- Subtle transitions and animations for menu opening/closing and page transitions.

## Original User Request:
I want a Next.js PWA that requires login for all access. There will be an app shell that has a mobile first responsive menu on the right, a top nav bar with a profile and logout icons and a main area where content will be displayed. Most of the content will be lists from firebase collections. Users will have role based access to determine which functions are available to them.
